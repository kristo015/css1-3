    <h1>BIG BANG THE THEORISE</h1>
    <p id="info_h">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics,
        philosophy, and metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:

        <h2 id="BigBang_h">BIG BAMG THEORY</h2>
        <p id="BingBang_p">this is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evoulition of the universe. The Big
            Bang theory
            suggests that the history of the universe nagan with the Big Bang around 13.8 bilion years ago. As a result
            of the Big Bang time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expension of the cosmos.

    <div id="BlackHole_box">
        <h2 id="BlackHole_h">BLACK HOLE THEORY</h2>
        <p id="BlackHole_p">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where
            gravity is so intense
            that
            nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.

        <h2 id="string_h">STRING THEORY</h2>
        <div id="string">
            String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world. According to this
            theory,
            we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional microscopic,
            non-material
            "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with different sizes and characteristics.

        <p id="string_p">
            Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that explains all
            fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum
            mechanics.

        <p id="string_p">
            Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the existence of
            additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the laws of physics.

        <p id="string_p">
            Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not point-like
            particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies, with each vibration
            corresponding to a different particle type.
